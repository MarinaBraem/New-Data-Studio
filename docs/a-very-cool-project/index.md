# # Today itâ€™s hardly to understand that women were not allowed to participate in marathon events 50 years ago. With vehemence women participants were excluded from the competitions. Only by the tenacity of the first women female marathon pioneers Bobbi Gibb and Katharine Switzer at the Boston Martahon was possible to tear down the wall. In the case of my infographic, I compared the cornerstones of the participant numbers i the 6 largest marathons in the word. The Boston Marathon as the oldest one, ran for 50 years without female participants. With the emergence of younger marathons the relationship between men and women becomes regulated. Where a ratio of 1: 100 existed at the beginning in the 1970ies, we are now arrived at a ratio of 2: 3. The great hunt from the women shows that women are very well able to put lengths of breath.
