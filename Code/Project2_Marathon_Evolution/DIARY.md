The Countries by the Boston Marathon Winners are very interesting: 
from 1897 to 1950 --> USA|CAN
from 1947 to 1988 --> Europe
from 1988 to today --> KEN|ETH

I try to figure out what will be the best proceed to complete my dataset. 
How can I scrape all these results-pages?

I realize, that the scraping stuff is overwhelming me for the moment. 
So I'm cleaning now just all tables for all 6 marathons for all winners.
The world records are interesting in this topic and the countries for the winners. 

I found as well the overview for the point system of the wmm's. 
Perhaps this will be easier to manage.

But I still wanna focus on the complete finisher number for the total, the men and the women.
