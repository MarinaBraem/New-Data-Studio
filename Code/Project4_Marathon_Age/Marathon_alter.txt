From a text I learned that the fastest age for marathon runners is 24 and for men 38.
I have therefore looked at the top 10 lists of the IAAF and come to another result.
There is a time difference from 1999 to 2017. in 2017, there are 6 women of 10 who are over 30 in the top 10.
In 1999 it was only 3. It has thus doubled. I found the same phenomenon with the men.

The numbers take on, if one the rage from the top 10 to the top 100 changed.

Where is the best age now?
